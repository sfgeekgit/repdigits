For doing math with rep digits

When my son was in kindergarten, he said to me: 
"Daddy, I have a new way of counting. It goes 1, 2, 3, 4,5,6,"
"This just sounds like regular counting"
"Hold on, it goes 6,7,8,9,  11"
"No ten?"
"Right, no ten, eleven, then....uh... 22 then 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99, then once you get to 99 the next counting number is one one one."
"Oh! I see! Then 222?"
"Yes"


In the years since we've done some interesting math with these numbers. We called them "The Falcon Sequence" but it turns out they have an official name "Rep Digits"
